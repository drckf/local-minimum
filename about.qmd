### About this blog 

Technology is often developed out in the open, through open source projects that allow one to follow along 
with the development process in addition to consuming the final product. But scientific research is usually done behind 
closed doors, for reasons I don't entirely understand. The thinking process that leads to a paper isn't shared, except 
among a few collaborators. This blog is my attempt at truly open scientific research. 

The blog is called "Local Minimum" because many of the ideas I share here will be early and immature. It's a nod to the 
way can systems can get stuck in a local minimum of an energy landscape. 


### About the author
Charles Fisher is typically interested in research at the intersection of physics, machine learning, and biology. 
He has a PhD in biophysics from Harvard University, a BS in biophysics from the University of Michigan, and did 
postdoctoral research in biophysics at Boston University and Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris. Following his time
in academia, he moved to industry where he worked at Pfizer and Leap Motion before starting Unlearn.AI. He was CEO
of Unlearn for nearly 8 years before stepping back to a board role so that he could get back to his roots and dive
into research again. Hence, this blog. 


### Acknowledgments
I'm often discussing my research with Pankaj Mehta and his group at Boston University, Austin Huang, Anton Loukianov,
and others.
