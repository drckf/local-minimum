## Welcome to the Local Minimum

This is a technical blog with long form posts about my research before it is ready
for publication in traditional journal articles. Most of this research will be at the 
intersection of statistical physics, machine learning, and biology. 
Some posts will be reviews, but most will be involve novel research and will
include both theoretical and experimental analyses, and sometimes just discussion 
of algorithms or code. For more information about this blog and its author, 
check out the [About](about.qmd) page.
